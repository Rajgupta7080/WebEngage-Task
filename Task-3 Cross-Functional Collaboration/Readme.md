# Problem Statement
## You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days.
## Note - You can only ask for an extension for 1 task from the above.

<br/>

<br/>

## Question 1 - What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this.
<br/>

### Ans :- <b> My approach to solving this issue would be to prioritize the tasks based on their importance and urgency. Since Task 2 has a campaign that needs to go live in the next 2 days, it is the higher priority task and I would ask for an extension for Task 1.</b>
<br/>

## Question 2 - How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) & Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.
<br/>

### Ans :- <b>My internal message to Manoj (Account Manager for Task 1) and Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) would be as follows:

Subject: Update on Tasks 1 and 2

Dear Manoj and Ravi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the current situation with regards to Tasks 1 and 2. Due to a family emergency, I won't be able to meet the original due date of both tasks for at least 3 more days.

Given the urgency of Task 2, I would like to ask for an extension for Task 1. I understand the importance of meeting the deadline for both tasks and I assure you that I am doing my best to get everything done as soon as possible. I will make sure that Task 2 is delivered on time, as per the original due date.

Please let me know if there are any further concerns or if you need more information from my end.

Thank You, Raj Gupta "</b>

## Question 3 - How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an email to the customer informing them about this).
<br/>

### Ans :- <b>To communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer, I would send the following email:
My email to the customer for Task 1 informing them about the delay would be as follows:

Subject: Update on Task 1
Dear Customer,
